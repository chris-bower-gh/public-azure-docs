# Azure Checklist Review — Audit Scripts

Reusable scripts for supplementing Azure Review Checklist engagements with resource inventory and utilisation data. These scripts are optional — use them when deeper evidence is needed to support or validate checklist findings.

See [03_Resource_Audit_Guide.md](../03_Resource_Audit_Guide.md) for guidance on when to include audit data and how it maps to checklist modules.

## How These Scripts Fit the Engagement

Azure Checklist Review engagements assess compliance with Azure best practices using the Microsoft Review Checklists tooling. These scripts provide two optional layers of supporting evidence:

### Phase 2 — Resource Inventory and Configuration

KQL queries run in **Azure Resource Graph Explorer** collect resource inventory and configuration data across subscriptions. This supplements checklist findings with a concrete asset register — confirming what is deployed and how it is configured, not just whether a best practice is met.

### Phase 3 — Utilisation Metrics

PowerShell scripts collect 30-day Azure Monitor metrics per resource type. Use these when a checklist finding requires evidence of actual usage patterns — for example, confirming whether an undersized or oversized resource warrants a recommendation.

**Two-stage approach:** Initial screen scripts use 30-day hourly averages to identify candidates. For flagged resources, run the corresponding `-deepdive` script (7-day 1-minute granularity) before drawing conclusions — hourly averages can mask short-duration spikes such as scheduled batch jobs.

## How to Run These Scripts

### KQL files

Run in **Azure Resource Graph Explorer**: portal.azure.com → search "Resource Graph Explorer". Scope to the relevant subscriptions before running.

### PowerShell scripts

Before running any PowerShell script:

1. Ensure `az login` has been completed with appropriate read access to the target subscriptions.
2. Populate the `# CONFIGURE` block at the top of each script with the relevant subscription IDs and resource details.
3. Output CSV files are written to the path set in `$outputDir` (default: `.\output`).
